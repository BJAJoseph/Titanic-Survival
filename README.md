# Titanic-Survival
Machine Learning in Python, Keras, Tensorflow

--

This is my first dip in the `kaggle` pool. I try to answer this competition first to get a feel of the competitions and so far, it's fun.

The Titanic algorithm will give a prediction of who among a dataset of passengers will have survived the disaster. On my first try, I used CNN which I thought would give the most accurate result. I was so wrong and got a very bad result.

Accuracy = 0.3792
It runs. But it's not learning.

I tried tweaking the model and was able to improve it a bit.

Accuracy = 0.6777
A little better.

I tried to follow a tutorial on `Youtube` about ML using the Titanic dataset as example. There were plenty but I followed the one by Ju Liu from NoSlidesConference. He used a Linear Regression classifier with plenty of visualizations.
